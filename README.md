A simplistic Vue.js based speedcubing timer.

## Roadmap
The following features are currently planned for implementation.
- [ ] Support for different puzzles and competitions
- [ ] Scrambler for WCA puzzles
- [ ] History and statistics
- [ ] Stackmat support

The timer is supposed to be minimalistic and clutter-free, so many features on some desktop based timing applications cannot be reasonably implemented.
