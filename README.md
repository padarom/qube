# qube
A simplistic Vue.js based speedcubing timer.

## Roadmap
The following features are currently planned for implementation.
- [ ] Support for different puzzles and competitions
- [x] Scrambler for WCA puzzles
- [x] History and statistics
- [x] Stackmat support (see [#4](https://github.com/padarom/qube/issues/4))

The timer is supposed to be minimalistic and clutter-free, so many features on some desktop based timing applications cannot be reasonably implemented.
